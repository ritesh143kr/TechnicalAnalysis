      "Para1":"The double top pattern is a bearish reversal pattern in technical analysis, often signaling the end of an uptrend and the beginning of a potential downtrend. It is characterized by two distinct peaks at approximately the same price level, separated by a trough.\n",

      "Para2":"First Peak:- The price rises to a peak, marking a new high, followed by a decline.\n\nTrough: After the first peak, the price declines to form a trough. This decline is usually moderate, but it is crucial that the price does not fall below a significant support level.\n\nSecond Peak:- The price then rises again to a level close to the first peak but fails to break through the resistance level created by the first peak. This failure to create a new high indicates weakness.\n\nNeckline:- The line drawn through the lowest point of the trough between the two peaks. This level acts as support.\n\nBreakdown:- The pattern is confirmed when the price declines again, breaking below the neckline. This breakdown signals a bearish reversal and often leads to further declines.\n\n",

      "Para3":"Volume:- Volume typically decreases during the formation of the second peak. A significant increase in volume upon breaking the neckline strengthens the signal of a bearish reversal.\n\nDuration:- The time between the two peaks can vary. The pattern is more reliable when it forms over a longer period, such as several weeks to months.\n\nConfirmation:- The pattern is only confirmed once the price breaks below the neckline. A retest of the neckline after the breakdown can occur, acting as a further confirmation of the new resistance level.\n\n",

      "bold8":"",
      "Para4":"Entry Point:- Traders might enter a short position once the price breaks below the neckline, ideally on increased volume.\n\nStop Loss:- A stop-loss order can be placed above the second peak to protect against a false breakout.\n\nTarget:- The price target is often calculated by subtracting the height of the pattern (distance from the peak to the neckline) from the breakout point.\n\n",

      "bold10":"",
      "Para5":"False Breakouts:- There can be false breakouts where the price briefly breaks below the neckline but then reverses back up.\n\nPattern Variations:- Variations in the height of the two peaks or a slanted neckline can complicate the pattern's interpretation.\n\n\n"

      "Para1":"The hammer candlestick is a pattern that is typically used by traders to identify potential reversals trends in price action. The hammer candlestick is formed when the price opens near its high, falls significantly during the trading session, and then rallies to close near its opening price.\n",
