      "Para1":"The hammer candlestick is a pattern that is typically used by traders to identify potential bullish reversal trends in price action. The hammer candlestick is formed when the price opens near its high, falls significantly during the trading session, and then rallies to close near its opening price.This occurs because buyers step in to support prices after an initial sell-off, indicating increased buying interest and possible upward momentum.\n",
